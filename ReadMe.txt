Within Java, a button component can be used for triggering different events. There are different types of buttons that can be utilised. Flemings Electrical Ltd based in the Republic of Ireland trade with the UK. On 1st January 2021, because of Brexit, extra details are required on their VAT return to handle Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA). They have hired you to develop an application which will allow a user to type in this extra information. The information that is required is as follows:
o	Year – integer value – greater than 2020 and less than 2050. 
o	Month – integer value – range 1 to 12. 
o	VAT Reference – string – minimum characters 10. 
o	Goods amount – float – should allow negative values.
Because Flemings Electrical do not trade with the UK every month, not all months require this information to be entered. You are required to:

a) Write a class to represent the PVA information required. You should ensure that the setter methods for your properties performs the required validation.

b) The requirements for this PVA input screen are as follows: 
i.	The user is allowed enter in the Year / Month. 
ii.	The user can then choose whether this Year/Month combination requires VAT information to be input. Utilise one of the GUI components to enable / disable the VAT Reference / Goods fields entry. These fields should only be enabled if the user has indicated that they have data for this month. Note – if there is no data to be entered, then only the year and month are saved to your class. 
iii.	A Cancel button is required on this input screen. If the user clicks this button, they should be asked to confirm they want to exit. Exit should close the PVA input screen.  
iv.	A Save button is required which allows you to save the data that the user entered. This button should only be enabled when the user has entered in valid data. When the Save button is clicked – the user should be asked to confirm that the data is correct. The data should be saved to a text file – no specific format required.
